      Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe,
      <strong>object-oriented programming language.</strong> It is intended to
      let programmers write once, run anywhere <del>WORA</del>, meaning that
      compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the
      need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode
      that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the
      underlying computer architecture.
      <hr> The syntax of Java is similar to C and
      C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. <br>The Java
      runtime provides dynamic capabilities
      <strike>such as reflection and runtime code modification</strike> that are
      typically not available in traditional compiled languages. Java gained
      popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming
      language since then.
      <mark
        >Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according
        to GitHub.</mark
      >
      Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of
      Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.
